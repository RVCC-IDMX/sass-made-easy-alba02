    <h3> By James Jeffrey Roche</h3>
    
    <p>BABY’S brain is tired of thinking</p> 
    <p>
        On the Wherefore and the Whence;
    </p>
    <p>  Baby’s precious eyes are blinking	</p>
    <p>  With incipient somnolence.</p>
    <p>With incipient somnolence.</p>
    <p> Little hands are weary turning</p>
     <p> Heavy leaves of lexicon;</p>	
     <p>    Little nose is fretted learning	</p>
     <p> How to keep its glasses on.	</p>
     <p>Baby knows the laws of nature	</p>
     <p>Are beneficent and wise;</p>
     <p>  His medulla oblongata	</p>
     <p>Bids my darling close his eyes,	</p>
     <p> And his pneumogastrics tell him	</p>
     <p> Quietude is always best</p>
     <p> When his little cerebellum</p>
     <p>   Needs recuperative rest.</p>
     <p>     Baby must have relaxation,</p>
     <p>   Let the world go wrong or right.</p>
     <p> Sleep, my darling, leave Creation	</p>
     <p>To its chances for the night.</p>
